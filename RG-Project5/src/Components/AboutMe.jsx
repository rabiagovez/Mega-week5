      <h1 className="biggest">WHO AM I?</h1>
      <h2 className="biggest2">Hello, I am Rabia GÃ¶vez. I am a 3rd year Computer Engineering student. Since my interest in software has been going on for a long time, I decided to study computer engineering. I was generally interested in the Front-end field. I did some work on HTML, CSS and JavaScript and did my internship in this field. I did some small-scale work with Python and Java. Also, lastly, T.R. I applied for the artificial intelligence training initiated by the Ministry of Industry and Technology. I want to improve myself and progress in this sector. While I was working on all these plans, I saw that the React.js course, which I always wanted to learn about Front-end, was opened in cooperation with Mega Software Academy and Uretken Academy. Thanks to this course, I want to improve my React knowledge and define myself as a full Front-end developer. I am also interested in image processing and office applications.</h2>
